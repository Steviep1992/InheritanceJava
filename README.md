# InheritanceJava
This repo is holding a simple example of inheritance that I wrote in Java. 

It starts with the TestPhone class, when it is ran it calls the phone class.
Once the phone class is called the program calls the Samsung class. 
Once the Samsung class is called the program calls the Iphone class.

This is a low level example of what inheritance is and how it works.
